# Balloon Pumping Model

This program, written in Go, simulates a balloon pumping model and generates charts based on the simulation for the balloon's volume, weight, surface tension, radius, and surface area.

## Introduction

The Balloon Pumping Model is a software tool developed in Go programming language. It aims to simulate the behavior of a balloon being pumped and provides visual representations of various parameters such as volume, weight, surface tension, radius, and surface area.

## Features

- Simulates the process of pumping a balloon.
- Generates charts illustrating the evolution of key parameters over time.
- Provides insights into the dynamics of balloon inflation.

## Installation

1. Ensure you have Go installed on your system. If not, follow the instructions on the [official Go website](https://golang.org/doc/install) to install it.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/your-username/balloon-pumping-model.git`.
3. Navigate to the project directory.
4. Run `go build` to build the executable file.

## Usage

1. After building the executable, run the program by executing the generated binary file.
2. Follow the on-screen instructions to set parameters for the simulation.
3. Once the simulation is complete, the program will generate charts displaying the evolution of various balloon parameters.
