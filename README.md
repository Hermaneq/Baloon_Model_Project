# Balloon Pumping Model

This program, written in Go, simulates a balloon pumping model and generates charts based on the simulation for the balloon's volume, weight, surface tension, radius, and surface area.

## Introduction

The Balloon Pumping Model is a software tool developed in Go programming language. It aims to simulate the behavior of a balloon being pumped and provides visual representations of various parameters such as volume, weight, surface tension, radius, and surface area.

## Features

- Simulates the process of pumping a balloon.
- Generates charts illustrating the evolution of key parameters over time.
- Provides insights into the dynamics of balloon inflation.
